Service and Leadership
======
* Pacific Science Center Life Sciences Research Weekend: 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018.
  * At the University of Washington Center for Game Science booth, I taught children and their parents how protein engineers discover cures to treat diseases, and explain how nanotechnology research at the University of Washington is advancing disease treatment options. Participating in this outreach program allowed me to translate my technical experience into casual language that boosts my local community's comprehension of nanotechnological research while inspiring young adults into science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields through interactive workshops.
* University of Washington Engineering Discovery Days: 2014, 2015, 2016.
  * At this joint exhibit between the Molecular Engineering and Sciences Institute and the Washington Nanofabrication Facility, I and fellow University of Washington students and faculty in engineering shared our research with the local Seattle community, particularly with children in K-8 grades.
